    <p class="govuk-body">The Product safety database is designed to improve information sharing amongst UK market surveillance authorities. It replaces two EU systems for managing product safety issues; ICSMS and RAPEX.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The ambition for the service is to build a shared system for managing product safety cases across the UK. This means that when an organisation is investigating a product in the future they will have a better set of information to draw on. For example, finding test results for similar products or seeing if the manufacturer has been looked into before.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This will reduce duplication and improve the quality of product safety and market surveillance activity in the UK.</p>
